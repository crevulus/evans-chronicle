# Evanstagram

An Evans-family-excusive photo-sharing social network.

My family and I often send pictures to one another via WhatsApp groups and the like, so I wanted somewhere we could upload and store our highlights for posterity. I created Evanstagram (get it? We're the _Evans_ family and it's a site like _Instagram_. ðŸ¦—) to serve as a digitised, ever-lasting photo album. Plus, as we are spread out across two continents, I wanted to add another method to connect to one another -- particularly during the pandemic that has kept us apart for over a year.

### Features

* Upload and share photos or videos with captions.
* Automatic timestamping, as well as geo-tagging via Google API.
* Mobile-first feat. mobile-only side-panel menu, but also desktop-ready.
* Auth, image storage, and photo data via Firebase.
